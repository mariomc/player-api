# Vimeo and SAPO Videos Embed API JS wrapper

This is a fork from the [Vimeo's JS API library (Froogaloop)](https://github.com/vimeo/player-api).

It's a wrapper made to interact with embeded videos in both [SAPO VÃ­deos](https://videos.sapo.pt/) and [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

Take a look at an [editable JS Fiddle](http://jsbin.com/benisu/) and the [Vimeo API Docs](http://developer.vimeo.com/player/js-api#universal-with-froogaloop)
